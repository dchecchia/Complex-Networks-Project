# Complex-Networks-Project
Group Project for the Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics course.

The Project consisted of studying three different growth model in Complex Networks Science:
- Axelrod's Model for Dissemination of Culture
- Voter Model
- Language Dynamics Competition Model

Each of these was assigned to different subset of 1-2 people. The task required a simulation of the main mechanisms across different topologies and parameters, in order to analyze convergence, limits and phase transitions.
Project was submitted and evaluated in early September 2023.
