# Complex-Networks-Project
Group Project for the Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics course.

The Project consisted of studying three different growth model in Complex Networks Science:
- **Axelrod's Model for Dissemination of Culture** (Davide Checchia, Giuseppe Bevilacqua)
- **Voter Model** (Kiamehr Javid, Jelin Raphael Akkara)
- **Language Dynamics Competition Model** (Joan Verguizas I Moliner)

Each of these was assigned to different subset of 1-2 people. The task required a simulation of the main mechanisms across different topologies and parameters, in order to analyze convergence, limits and phase transitions.

Made using R and igraph library.

Project was submitted and evaluated in early September 2023.
